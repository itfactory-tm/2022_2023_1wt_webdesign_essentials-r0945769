    <h1>HAIKU</h1>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>The haiku is a form of Japanese poetry, written in three lines of which the first line has 5, the second line 7 and the third line has 5 syllables. The haiku, in its classical form, expresses a momentary experience, sometimes linked to and inspired by Zen. The haiku is a thimble full of emotion, in which there is little room for analyses and approximate descriptions.</p>
