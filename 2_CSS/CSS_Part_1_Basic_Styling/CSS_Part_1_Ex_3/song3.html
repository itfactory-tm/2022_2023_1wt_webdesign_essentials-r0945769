        <h2>The wild rover</h2>
        <p>And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer<br> And now I'm returnin' with gold in great store<br> And I never will play the wild rover no more.</p>
        <p> And it's No! Nay! Never!<br> No nay never no more<br> And I'll play the wild rover<br> No never no more.</p>
        <p>I went to an alehouse I used to frequent<br> And I told the landlady my money was spent<br> I asked her for credit, she answered me nay<br> Saying, "Custom like yours I can have any day!"</p>
        <p> I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright<br> And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight<br> She said, "I have whiskeys and wines of the best<br> And the words that I told you were only in jest."</p>
        <p>I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done<br> And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son<br> And when they have kissed me as oft-times before<br> I never will play the wild rover no more.</p>
