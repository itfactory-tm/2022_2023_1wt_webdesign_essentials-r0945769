        <h2>Philip Kotler: Mister Marketing</h2>

        <h3>The Man</h3>

        <p>Philip <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kotler">Kotler</a> (born 27 May 1931) is an American marketing author, consultant, and professor; the S. C. Johnson &amp; Son Distinguished Professor of International Marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University (1962-2018). He gave the definition of marketing mix. He is the author of over 80 books.Kotler helped create the field of social marketing that focuses on helping individuals and groups modify their behaviors toward healthier and safer living styles. He also created the concept of <span>"demarketing"</span> to aid in the task of reducing the level of demand. He also developed the concepts of <span>"prosumers," "atmospherics," and "societal marketing." </span> He is regarded as,"The Father of Modern Marketing" by many scholars.</p>

        <h3>His Ideas</h3>
        <p>When Kotler became professor of marketing in the early sixties, that profession was more of a skill than a science. Kotler identified a serious lack of theorizing and substantiation, and went to work to deliver it. He derived his building blocks from mathematics, economics, behavioral sciences and organizational science. This led to the publication of his two classics: Marketing Management and Marketing Models. We list the essentials:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Marketing management encompasses the entire process of product development, pricing, promotion and distribution, both of goods and services (and even ideas). The goal is to initiate an exchange between the producer and his target groups in such a way that both the needs of the target group and those of the producer are realized.</li>
            <li>Marketing is more than retail, sales and advertising. It must be about analyzing industries and players, designing strategies for global markets, managing product lifecycles, and setting up large-scale sales and distribution.</li>
            <li>Marketers need to help managers choose between large and niche markets, existing and new brands, push and pull factors, home and foreign markets, add value and lower prices, invest and divest in sales and advertising.</li>
            <li>The marketer has four main means of influencing demand: the intrinsic properties of the product, the price of that product, the location where the product is offered, and the promotion of the product. In other words: the famous 4 Ps.</li>
            <li>Good companies meet a need, superior companies create markets. You only become a market leader when you're able to bring new products to life, new services, a new lifestyle - and when you can use it to raise people's living standards.</li>
        </ul>
