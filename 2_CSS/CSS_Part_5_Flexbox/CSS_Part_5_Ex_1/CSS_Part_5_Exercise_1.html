                <h1>Scheduled finale: January 10, 2016</h1>
                <p>Producer Tony Visconti declared after Bowie's death that the album Blackstar was intended by Bowie as a farewell gift to his fans as a carefully planned "finale". After Bowie's death Tony Visconti told in an interview with the American music magazine Rolling Stone that Bowie had told him a year ago that he was suffering from cancer, but in the summer of 2015 he heard that treatments had been well received.</p>
                <p>However, the cancer came back later and in November 2015 Bowie knew he was incurably ill. According to Visconti, Bowie wrote five new songs in the weeks before his death and called him a week before his death to make arrangements for the recording of a next album. "Bowie must have thought he would live a few more months," says Visconti in Rolling Stone. It is still unclear whether a Bowie album will be released with unpublished new music.</p>
